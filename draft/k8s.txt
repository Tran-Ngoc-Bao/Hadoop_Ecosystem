Architecture of Kubernetes:
    kubectl:
    Master Node:
        API Server: The entry point for all the REST commands used to control the cluster
        Scheduler: Responsible for distributing the workload
        Controller Manager: A daemon that runs in a non terminating loop and is responsible for collecting and sending information to the API server. Responsible for the overall health of the entire cluster by ensuring that nodes are up and running all the time and correct pods are running as mentioned in the specs file
        etcd: A distributed key-value lightweight database
    Worker Node:
        Kubelet: A primary node agent which communicates with the master node and executes on each worker node inside the cluster
        Kube-Proxy: Maintains the distributed network across all the nodes, pods, and containers and exposes the services across the outside world
        Pods: A group of containers that are deployed together on the same host
        Docker: The containerization platform that is used to package your application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers to make sure that your application works seamlessly in any environment which can be development or test or production
