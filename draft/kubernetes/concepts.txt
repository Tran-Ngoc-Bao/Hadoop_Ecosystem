I. Overview
1. Kubernetes Components
	Control Plane Components:
		kube-apiserver: The core component server that exposes the Kubernetes HTTP API
		etcd: Consistent and highly-available key value store for all API server data
		kube-scheduler: Looks for Pods not yet bound to a node, and assigns each Pod to a suitable node
		kube-controller-manager: Runs controllers to implement Kubernetes API behavior
		cloud-controller-manager (optional): Integrates with underlying cloud provider(s)
	Node Components:
		kubelet: Ensures that Pods are running, including their containers.
		kube-proxy (optional): Maintains network rules on nodes to implement Services.
		Container runtime: Software responsible for running containers.
